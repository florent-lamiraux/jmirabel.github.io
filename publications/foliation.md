### Abstract

This paper deals with manipulation planning.
First, we propose a new tool called the **constraint graph** to describe the various motion constraints relative to a manipulation planning problem.
Then, we describe a problem arising for some manipulation planning problems called the **crossed foliation issue**.
We propose a extension of RRT algorithm that explores the leaves of the foliations generated by motion constraints and that solves the crossed foliation problem.
Finally, we show a wide variety of problem that our approach can solve.
