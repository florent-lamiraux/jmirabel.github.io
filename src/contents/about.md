#Short bio

<img style="float:left;display:inline; width:auto; margin: auto 1em;" alt="Portait" src="img/profile.png"/>
I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student at [LAAS-CNRS] in Toulouse, France.
I'm part of the [Gepetto] team, working on manipulation planning. Part of my work is 
devoted to humanoid robots, but most of it applies to the motion planning in collections of
submanifold of a high dimensional configuration spaces.

The implementation of my research is integrated in the [Humanoid Path Planner][HPP] library,
mainly in the package [hpp-manipulation].
See [this](/humanoid-path-planner/) for additional details.
I have also been working on an - still - unofficial [graphical user interface][hpp-gui].
